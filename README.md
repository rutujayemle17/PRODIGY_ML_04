# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition Model 🤖

## 📜 Description

This project focuses on developing a **hand gesture recognition model** that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. The goal is to enhance intuitive human-computer interaction and enable gesture-based control systems.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Identify gestures in real-time using video input.
- **Gesture Classification**: Classify various hand gestures for interactive applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to facilitate intuitive human-computer interaction.

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained using the dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog), which includes a variety of hand gestures for robust training and evaluation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results and performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-recognition.git
  

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   
   cd hand-gesture-recognition
  

3. **Install the required packages**:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. **Download the dataset from Kaggle** [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) and follow the instructions to set it up.

5. **Run the main script**:
 
   python main.py
   

## 📈 Usage

After training the model, you can use it to recognize hand gestures in real-time by running the classification script with video input.
